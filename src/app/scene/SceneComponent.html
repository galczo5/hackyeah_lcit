        <b class="text-xl">Composting</b> is the processing of organic matter into compost in the course of natural
        biochemical
        processes with the participation of microorganisms. In the EU Member States, having a home
        composter is popular, and it is also becoming a noticeable trend in Poland, as it is a great way to
        produce compost – a valuable material for fertilizing the soil, as well as a method for managing
        organic waste (bio), generated each day at our homes and gardens
